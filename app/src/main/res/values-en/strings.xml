    <!-- FAQs -->
    <string name="faq_off_signal_heading">"Down" Signal</string>
    <string name="faq_off_signal_question">When do the judges give the down signal?</string>
    <string name="faq_off_signal_answer">The athlete is required to stay motionless, to have arms and legs extended and to stand with the feet on the same line. If the athlete performed an incorrect movement, such as extending his arms incompletely at the finish of the lift, the attempt is counted as \'No lift\' and the referees give the down signal as well.</string>

    <string name="faq_bad_attempt_jerking_heading">Bad lift in cleaning and jerking</string>
    <string name="faq_bad_attempt_jerking_question">When is an attempt in cleaning and jerking invalid?</string>
    <string name="faq_bad_attempt_jerking_answer">The following movements require an attempt in cleaning and jerking to be counted as \'No lift\':\n - a part of the body other than the feet touches the platform\n - touching the thighs or the knees with the elbows or the upper arms\n - extending the arms incompletely at the finish of the lift</string>

    <string name="winner_team_competition_heading">Winner of a team competition</string>
    <string name="winner_team_competition_question">Who is the winner of a team competition?</string>
    <string name="winner_team_competition_answer">The winner of a team competition (e.g. a national league competition) is the team that acquires the most relative points.\nEvery athlete receives a value depending on his bodyweight. This value is subtracted from his heaviest successful lifts in snatching and in cleaning and jerking.\nAn athlete with a bodyweight of 80kg receives a withdrawal of 80 points. If the athlete snatches 130kg and cleans and jerks 150kg, he gains 130+150–2*80 = 280–160 = 120 relative points. The relative points of all team members of a team are added up. The team with the most relative points is the winner of the team competition.</string>

    <string name="winner_single_competition_heading">Winner of an individual competition</string>
    <string name="winner_single_competition_question">Who is the winner of an individual competition?</string>
    <string name="winner_single_competition_answer">The winner of a bodyweight category is the athlete who lifts the highest overall result. It consists of the highest successful lift in snatching and the highest successful lift in cleaning and jerking.\nA male athlete with a bodyweight of 80kg is assigned to the bodyweight category -85kg. The athlete snatches 130kg and cleans and jerks 150kg so his overall result is 280kg. The athlete wins if there is no other athlete with a higher overall result.</string>
